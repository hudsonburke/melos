Oneline install:
```bash
pip install musclemimic-models
```

Load a model in two lines:
```python
import musclemimic_models as mm

model, data = mm.load("myofullbody")   # or "bimanual"
```

Other helpers:
```python
import mujoco, mujoco.viewer
import musclemimic_models as mm

# List available models
print(list(mm.REGISTRY))               # ['bimanual', 'myofullbody']

# Get the raw MJCF path
xml_path = mm.get_xml_path("bimanual")
model = mujoco.MjModel.from_xml_path(str(xml_path))

# Launch the interactive viewer
model, data = mm.load("bimanual")
mujoco.viewer.launch(model, data)
```

Musclemimic_models is part of the [**MuscleMimic**](https://github.com/amathislab/musclemimic) research project, in which we created physiologically realistic, muscle-driven musculoskeletal models built on top of [MyoSuite](https://github.com/myohub/myosuite).  This repository is designed to provide users with two musculoskeletal models: MyoBimanualArm and MyoFullBody, that could be used together or independently from the Musclemimic pipeline. 

MyoFullBody enables realistic full-body motion control with pure muscle actuation. Below are example fullbody motions demonstrating the model's capabilities, all policies were trained with MuscleMimic.

**MyoBimanualArm** focuses on upper-limb musculoskeletal control, enabling faster training convergence while preserving full finger articulation capabilities.

## Musculoskeletal Models

Both musculoskeletal models are built on MyoSuite components, combining **[MyoArm](https://github.com/MyoHub/myo_sim/tree/main/arm)**, **[MyoLegs](https://github.com/MyoHub/myo_sim/tree/main/leg)**, and **[MyoTorso](https://github.com/MyoHub/myo_sim/tree/main/torso)** models with Hill-type muscle actuators in MuJoCo. This enables studying motor control at the **neuromuscular level** and realistic muscle output, rather than via idealized joint torque controllers.

### Environment Summary

| Model           | Type        | Joints | Muscles | DoFs | Focus                        |
|-----------------|-------------|--------|---------|---------|------------------------------|
| MyoBimanualArm  | Fixed-base  | 76 (36*)    | 126 (64*)     | 54 (14*) | Upper-body manipulation      |
| MyoFullBody     | Free-root   | 123 (83*)    | 416 (354*)    | 72 (32*) | Locomotion and manipulation    |

##### $^*$ denotes configurations with finger muscles temporarily disabled. 

### MyoBimanualArm Environment

The **MyoBimanualArm** environment is designed for **upper-body manipulation task**. Explicit contacts are enabled in between both arms and with the thorax.

</p>

### MyoFullBody Environment

The **MyoFullBody** environment provides a **comprehensive full-body musculoskeletal system** with full biomechanical detail and rich contact dynamics, suitable for **locomotion**, **manipulation**, and **whole-body imitation**. We explicitly enable additional collision pairs, such as leg–leg, arm–leg, foot-foot, to capture the required self-contact behavior, including bimanual interactions.

</p>

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The minimum required MuJoCo version for both models is `mujoco==3.2.1`. To use spec with the main Musclemimic environment, please use `mujoco>=3.3.0`. 

### Overview

The structure of the Musclemimic model is as follows. We use MyoFullBody as an example. 
```
musclemimic_models/
└── model/
    ├── arm/
    │   ├── assets/
    │   └── myoarm_bimanual.xml
    ├── body/
    │   └── myofullbody.xml
    ├── head/
    │   └── assets/
    ├── leg/
    │   └── assets/
    ├── torso/
    │   └── assets/
    ├── meshes/
    └── scene/
└── tests/
```
- `assets/` : includes both the kinematics chain files and the assets definition files for each body segment that its under. 
- `meshes/` : shared mesh files used across models for bones and skulls
- `scene/` : MJCF “scene” files used in both MSK as backgrounds
- `arm/`, `body/`, `head/`, `leg/`, `torso/` : model components and their associated assets/
- `*.xml` : MJCF model definition(s) (e.g., `myofullbody.xml`, `myoarm_bimanual.xml`)
- `test/`: testing files for symmetry between bodies, geoms, sites and muscle

### Usage

#### Via Pypi
Install:

```bash
pip install musclemimic-models
```


#### Via `git clone`
Clone and install editable (recommended for development):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amathislab/musclemimic_models.git
cd musclemimic_models
pip install -e .
```

### MSK Model Refinement and Validation
**Muscle Jump and Symmetry**

While building MyoFullBody and MyoBimanualArm, we corrected left–right limb asymmetries and addressed several unexpected muscle-jumping behaviors. A few representative fixes are shown below.

**Muscle Validation**

We also cross-validate the current model using previously published cadaver studies and MRI data. A few illustrative examples are included here.
